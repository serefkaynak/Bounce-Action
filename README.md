Bounce Action
Bounce Action is an interactive web-based project that allows users to control a bouncing ball using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The ball reacts to screen edges, simulating a bouncing effect when it reaches the edges. The ball also gives a "wind effect" when its speed exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, a custom context menu is implemented which provides options to stop the ball or reset its position.

Features
Control ball movement with arrow keys.
Ball bounces off screen edges.
Friction simulation as the ball gradually stops.
Wind effect on high speeds.
Custom context menu for additional controls.

How to Use
Movement: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the ball.
Context Menu: Right-click anywhere on the screen to open the custom context menu.
Stop Ball: Stops the ball's movement immediately.
Reset Position: Resets the ball's position to the center of the screen.
